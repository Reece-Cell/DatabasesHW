Week 01
Programmer: <Reece Whitelaw>
Partner: <Rakery Cheng>
How much time did your spend reviewing your partern's code:  <30 minutes>

The following is repeated for each item brought up at the review.

Item Description: <Delete method not finished. The method does not have sufficient code to run and will automatically fail if executed.
This code needs to take advantage of the written search function and call the remove method for arraylists. Small, easy fix.>
Classification:   code Error
Resolution:  YES


Item Description: <The formatting of the 'lookup' function is pretty difficult to read due to how its formatted. Changing the formatting a bit would make it easier to read.>
Classification:   suggestion
Resolution:  if NO, why not?
Because ultimately the difference in styling is just that; a different style than my own. Although I find it hard to read, Rakjang does not.

Item Description: <Lots of erroneous uses of casting and of the command 'this.' for when making loops.
Because there is only one "Instances" arraylist being used, such specificity isn't required and simply complicates or conflates your code. >
Classification:   code Error | suggestion | comments
Resolution:  YES | NO | if NO, why not?

Item Description: <Many of the methods will end up throwing an exception unless a return statement is provided. Provide return statements of either Null or Zero (whatever fits the
context) to prevent the code from displaying errors.>
Classification:   code Error
Resolution:  YES

Item Description: <Many of the loops simply have i = 0 without actually incrementing its values through iterations. To fix this Rakjang should use
either for loops or some other kind of iterator so get to indexes within the arraylist. His current iterators will not work.>
Classification:   code Error
Resolution:  YES
